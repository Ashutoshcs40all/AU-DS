    "    This code implements a basic linear search algorithm to find the index of a given element (x) in an array (arr). Here's an explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "search Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters: arr is the input array, N is the length of the array, and x is the target element to search.\n",
    "The function iterates through each element in the array using a for loop.\n",
    "If the current element is equal to the target element (x), it returns the index of that element.\n",
    "If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1.\n",
    "Driver Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "An array arr is defined: [2, 3, 4, 10, 40].\n",
    "The target element x is set to 10.\n",
    "The length of the array is obtained using len(arr) and stored in N.\n",
    "Function Call:\n",
    "\n",
    "The search function is called with the array (arr), length (N), and target element (x).\n",
    "The result of the search is stored in the variable result.\n",
    "Print Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the result is -1, it prints \"Element is not present in the array.\"\n",
    "If the result is not -1, it prints \"Element is present at index\" followed by the index value.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For the given array [2, 3, 4, 10, 40] and target element 10, the output would be \"Element is present at index 3\" since 10 is present at index 3 in the array."

    "## What's use of this in above code  if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "\n",
    "    The line if __name__ == \"__main__\": is a common Python idiom that checks if the Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module into another script. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "    __name__ Variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, __name__ is a special variable that holds the name of the current module.\n",
    "    When a Python script is executed, the __name__ variable is set to \"__main__\" if the script is the main program being run.\n",
    "    if __name__ == \"__main__\": Condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "    This condition checks whether the script is being run as the main program.\n",
    "    If the script is the main program, the code block under this condition will be executed.\n",
    "    Use in the Given Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the provided code, the block of code under if __name__ == \"__main__\": contains the driver code that demonstrates and tests the search function.\n",
    "    It's a good practice to encapsulate the main execution logic of a script within this block. This ensures that the code inside this block is only executed when the script is run directly and not when  \n",
    "     it's imported as a module in another script.\n",
    "    Example Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you had another Python script that wanted to use the search function from this script as a module, the code inside if __name__ == \"__main__\": would not be executed. This helps prevent unintended side \n",
    "     effects when the script is imported elsewhere.\n",
    "In summary, using if __name__ == \"__main__\": is a best practice to structure your Python code in a way that allows reusable modules while also providing an entry point for direct script execution."
